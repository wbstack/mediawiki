This project uses [TypeScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript).

The fact that different parts of this project are built for different target architectures, namely browsers and node servers (buzz word: "isomorphism/universal rendering"), is reflected in the TypeScript configuration. The different targets are organized in individual files. Notable differences between them are the `src/` files included and libraries available.

* `tsconfig.base.json` The base configuration that is inherited by all other configurations
* `tsconfig.server.json` The configuration used to build for the server
* `tsconfig.json` The configuration used to build for the client
    > This file should really be called `tsconfig.client.json` but this is not possible until the vue-cli typescript plugin allows for the tsconfig name to be configurable
* `tsconfig.all.json` A merged configuration used for house-keeping (e.g. linting) tasks - not to build code

The configuration of the `src/` files is such that code to be executedâ€¦
* **in the client** can make use of all files but the ones in `src/server` and use all types but the ones defined in `src/types/server`
* **on the server** can make use of all files but the ones in `src/client` and use all types but the ones defined in `src/types/client`

We decided to reflect the fact that the project has to be built for either target architecture in the way [dependencies](/package.json) are modeled. Only packages truly needed to run the server are (production) "dependencies", all other packages - needed at build time only - are "dev dependencies".
