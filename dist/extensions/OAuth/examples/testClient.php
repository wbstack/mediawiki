/**
 * Testing integration with MediaWiki OAuth Extension
 *
 * The current extension follows OAuth 1.0a spec and while the
 * extension works, you have to be aware of a few quirks.
 *
 * This sample is there to help you work your mind through the OAuth
 * process. Its assuming your MediaWiki installation has this extension
 * installed so you can become your own OAuth service provider. In other
 * words, users in the wiki will be able to make various APIs calls
 * to this wiki using OAuth tokens.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *
 *   Remember that OAuth 1.0 expects that the GET Request parameters
 *   are sorted in some order, then to have it hashed.
 *
 *   In relation to MW; One known caveat is that the `$baseurl` has to
 *   be calling to your MediaWiki's `index.php` with
 *   `index.php?title=Special:OAuth` directly.
 *
 *   Otherwise the extension will return an URL that way, and will break the hash
 *   signature and you will get an error.

	************************

	Step two!

	So far, we made one request and we should have what we need to get acknowledgement from the end user.

	In order to continue, we have to ask the user for a permission. With what we just did, it gave us a one-time URL to send our user to.

	The process can continue only if the user accepted it. Once accepted, MediaWiki's OAuth Extension creates an "oauth_verifier" string that you need to give for the next step.

	Now, WITH YOUR WEB BROWSER, follow this link and pass through the validation.

	Link: {$baseurl}/authorize&oauth_token={$token->key}&oauth_consumer_key={$consumerKey}
