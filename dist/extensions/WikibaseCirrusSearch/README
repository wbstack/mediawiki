MediaWiki extension: WikibaseCirrusSearch
-----------------------------------------

This extension implements ElasticSearch-based search for Wikibase.

Dependencies
------------

This extension relies on Wikibase and CirrusSearch extensions to be installed and fully functional.
Please refer to documentation of these extensions for instructions on how to install them.

This extension relies on the wikimedia search-extra plugin for elasticsearch to be installed to
the elasticsearch cluster. Please refer to documentation of the plugin for instructions on how
to install it.

Configurations
--------------

Please see the description of available configuration options in docs/config.wiki. All variables are stored in
globals with wgWBCS prefix, e.g. wgWBCSUseCirrus.

Development
-----------

The fastest way to get started with WikibaseCirrusSearch development is to use MediaWiki-Vagrant.
1.  Follow steps here: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Vagrant#Quick_start
2.  Now execute the following:
vagrant enable-role wikibasecirrussearch
vagrant provision

This can take some time but it produces a clean development environment in a virtual machine
that has everything required to run Cirrus.
