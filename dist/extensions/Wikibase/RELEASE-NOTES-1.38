== Upgrading notes for 1.38 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.38 upgrades are below:

Wikibase 1.38 features a new change dispatching scheme, replacing the old one.
If you were regularly running the `dispatchChanges.php` and `pruneChanges.php` maintenance scripts,
you can stop doing that now (e.g. remove any such cron jobs), they are no longer necessary.
For the migration, we suggest the following procedure:

- Run `pruneChanges.php --ignore-dispatch --keep-days 30`, to remove very old changes.
  (“Changes” refers to entries in the Wikibase change dispatching mechanism –
  your revision history will be kept, of course.)
- Set the wiki to read-only mode.
- Run `dispatchChanges.php` and wait until there is nothing left to dispatch.
  (Terminate the script once it says “Idle: No client wiki found in need of dispatching.”)
- Run `runJobs.php`, including on any client wikis, to process any dispatched changes.
- Run `pruneChanges.php`, to remove changes that are now dispatched.
- Update the code of the wiki (and any client wikis) to 1.38.
- Perform any regular MediaWiki post-update steps,
  such as updating Composer dependencies and running `update.php`.
- Run `ResubmitChanges.php`, to move remaining changes into the job queue.
- Resume automatic job runners, if you have any (now using the new code).

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.38 ===

==== New configuration ====

* ...

==== Changed configuration ====

* (client) (T293246) If you configure your own entity sources,
 and the entity source referred to by the `itemAndPropertySourceName` setting has a string as the `repoDatabase`,
 then that string must also be a site ID of the repo wiki.
 (This was true before in some setups, but is more important now.)
 If you have a single wiki that is both a repo and a client,
 it’s recommended to set the `repoDatabase` to `false`.
