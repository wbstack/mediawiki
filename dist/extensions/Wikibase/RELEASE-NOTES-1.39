=== Action API changes in 1.39 ===

* T104344: The wbsearchentities response has a new `display` field for each result. It may contain a `label` and `description` key.
Each of those will contain a `text` and a `language` key with the respective data.
The top-level `label`, `description` and `aliases` keys of each result are now considered deprecated and should no longer be used.

=== Languages updated in 1.39 ===

Wikibase supports over 300 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

=== Breaking changes in 1.39 ===

* (T114577) The maintenance script populateInterwiki.php was removed, use the same script from core.
* (T140850) The php entry point were removed, use wfLoadExtension instead.

=== Deprecations in 1.39 ===

Use the new FallbackLabelDescriptionLookupFactory service instead:
it has a very similar interface, but returns lookups that also resolve redirects.
