This directory contains libraries registering Resource Loader modules used by the View component of Wikibase.

Libraries are installed as git submodules rooted in this directory.
Resource Loader modules consisting of files from the library should be defined by adding a relevant entry in resources.php file (and possibly in resources subdirectory).

If the library files are part of Resource Loader modules used in tests, modules should be defined by adding the entry to resources.test.php.

If the library contains i18n messages that should be registered for the used in Wikibase, make sure to update i18n.php accordingly.

When updating the library, update the state of the submodule as desired, and make sure to commit the state of the submodule to the "main" Wikibase git repository.
