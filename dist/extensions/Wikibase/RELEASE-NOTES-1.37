== Upgrading notes for 1.37 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.37 upgrades are below:

When upgrading to 1.37 from 1.35 or 1.36 we supply a simple php script
for administrators to run before the actual update happens.
The script gives recommended settings based on the current configuration.
You can download it from https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P16814
and save it in the Wikibase folder of your mediawiki installation.

Execute it as a normal maintenance script and replace the legacy repositories
configuration with the new entitySources one.
