== Upgrading notes for 1.37 ==

Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!
Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.37 upgrades are below:

When upgrading to 1.37 from 1.35 or 1.36 we supply a simple php script
for administrators to run before the actual update happens.
The script gives recommended settings based on the current configuration.
You can download it from https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/P16814
and save it in the Wikibase folder of your mediawiki installation.

Execute it as a normal maintenance script and replace the legacy repositories
configuration with the new entitySources one.

...

The prototype feature "Federated Properties" is disabled this this release.
If you are using "Federated Properties" and upgrade to this release, the feature
will be disabled and no properties will appear to exist.
