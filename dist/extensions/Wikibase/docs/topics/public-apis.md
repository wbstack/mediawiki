# Public APIs

The PHP interfaces of this extension may not be used by other extensions. None of the PHP APIs have any stability guarantees. An exception are extensions that fully cover these usages with unit tests which are run by the CI pre-merge and are integrated in the Wikidata build.

*TODO*: Explain how this extension can be used by other Mediawiki extension, which type of public APIs there are (HTTP API, Mediawiki hooks, composer components, PHP classes, etc) and what stability guarantees are available and how these are annotated on the individual parts (e.g. class level docs).
