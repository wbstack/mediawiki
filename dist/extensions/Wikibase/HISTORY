== Upgrading notes for 1.35 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

Some specific notes for Wikibase 1.35 upgrades are below:

The term storage in Wikibase has seen significant changes and has been under
migration on Wikidata from the old wb_terms table to the new normalized model
for a significant period of time.

In April of 2019 the Wikidata team adopted a migration strategy (T220480)
where the two storage models would be living side by side for the period of
the migration. The migration has happened for reads and writes which has been
controlled by a set of temporary variables that determine which storage will
be used. Since March of 2020 wikidata was set to not read from the old
wb_terms table anymore and during fall of 2020 the wb_terms table was
officially dropped (T208425) on the development branch.

The following configuration settings have been added to support this migration
on Wikidata and will be removed in upcoming releases.

* (repo) tmpPropertyTermsMigrationStage
* (repo) tmpItemTermsMigrationStages
* (repo) tmpItemSearchMigrationStage
* (repo) tmpPropertySearchMigrationStage

When upgrading to 1.35 this migration will happen primarily in jobs that run on
the repository. Therefore it might be necessary to execute runJobs.php until
the new term storage has been fully populated or by increasing the job run rate
by changing the value of $wgJobRunRate. On smaller Wikibase instances this
migration process will automatically be handled by running update.php.

Don't forget to backup your database!
